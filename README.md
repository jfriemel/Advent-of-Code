## Running 2021 Solutions
For my 2021 setup, I created a Java 17 Maven project. I copied some of the code from Dave Burke's Advent of Code Java template (https://github.com/dave-burke/advent-of-code-java-starter).

To be able to run my code, you first need to insert your input files in the `src/main/resources` directory with file names `inputDD.txt` where `DD` is the day of the month (e.g. `input04.txt` for day 4). Then you can run the program with two arguments. The first argument is the day for which you want to see the solution to your input. The second parameter is the part of the puzzle that you want to see solved (each day's puzzle is split into two parts). If you want to see both solutions, just put a `0` as the second argument.
